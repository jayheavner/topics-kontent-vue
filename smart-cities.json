He set forth the slogan “the citizens are the mayor” and pursued collaborative governance with the citizens in the policy decision making process. Park as a mayor realized the importance of going beyond national borders and strengthening city-to-city cooperation when tackling the many common challenges that the world faces. So he assumed many leadership responsibilities in various organizations, such as WeGO, an organization to promote e-governance and smart cities, GSEF, an organization to find solutions to social problems through social economy, ICLEI, C40, and more."

He previously served as a Presidential Innovation Fellow on CPS, a program by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. During his fellowship, he co-led the SmartAmerica Challenge, which brought together IoT technologies and CPS across the nation to demonstrate how they can provide concrete examples of the socio-economic benefits.\n\nPrior to joining US government, he was Co-founder and CTO of Millennial Net, Inc., which was one of the first to successfully commercialize low-power wireless network and Internet of Things technology from academia. His work and achievements have been recognized through awards including MIT Technology Review’s Top Innovators under 35 and Red Herring’s Top 5 Innovators. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
